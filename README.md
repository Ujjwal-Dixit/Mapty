# Mapty Workout Tracker

This application is a workout tracker that allows users to log their running and cycling exercises. Users can input details like distance, duration, cadence (for running), and elevation (for cycling). The app displays the workouts on a map with markers and also lists them below the map.

## How to Use

1. **Adding a Workout**:

   - Choose the workout type (running or cycling).
   - Enter the distance and duration.
   - For running, also input the cadence. For cycling, input the elevation.
   - Submit the form.

2. **Viewing Workouts**:

   - Workouts are displayed as markers on the map and as a list below it.
   - Clicking on a workout in the list or on the map will focus on its location on the map.

3. **Resetting Data**:
   - To clear all workouts and reset the application, use the reset button.

## Running the Application

To run the application, open the HTML file in a web browser. Ensure that JavaScript is enabled in the browser settings.

## Dependencies
